# ML-PROJECT

Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare
industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting
presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such
information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors
who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.
This project is to predict whether a person is having a heart disease or not based on
his health conditions like blood pressure, cholesterol etc.
